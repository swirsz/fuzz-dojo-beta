Run `/challenge/run` to copy fuzz drivers into `/home/hacker/fuzz-dojo/{project}`

Edit each of these files and add comments to the code to demonstrate your understanding of their operation. A flag will be provided when sufficient comments are added to each driver, and your comments will be evaluated later.

Fuzz Introspector
https://storage.googleapis.com/oss-fuzz-introspector/sqlite3/inspector-report/20250406/fuzz_report.html

Sqlite3 is an open-source relational database written in C.  It has a single fuzz driver that reaches 76% of the code, by parsing random data as SQL statements.  

Unreached sections of code are distributed through a wide number of functions, making targeting these areas fairly difficult.  There appears to be Json parsing, file I/O, and other small miscellaneous sections with some potential.
