Run `/challenge/run` to copy fuzz drivers into `/home/hacker/fuzz-dojo/{project}`

Edit each of these files and add comments to the code to demonstrate your understanding of their operation. A flag will be provided when sufficient comments are added to each driver, and your comments will be evaluated later.

Fuzz Introspector
https://storage.googleapis.com/oss-fuzz-introspector/arduinojson/inspector-report/20250411/fuzz_report.html

ArduinoJson is a C++ JSON library

Fuzz introspective reports that it has 99.51% static reachability, but only 49% actual coverage is being reached by the 2 existing fuzz drivers.

Plenty of functions in the code coverage report show 0% coverage, and these would be ideal to call with a new fuzz driver.
