This module is identical to the projects module.  Take what you've learned from the 'Understanding Fuzz Drivers' module and implement your plan from the 'Planning New Fuzz Drivers' module to make a simple fuzz driver that achieves at least a 5% boost in total project coverage.

casync is a Content Addressable Data Synchronizer, a tool that combines the rsync algorithm with content addressable storage.

This projects has a single fuzz driver that compresses and decomposes a stream of random data, but only hits 10% of the project code. Many different compression options, such as XZ and LibZ are not called, and none of the utility functions are executed.  The github project page lists a number of operations that could be implemented in fuzz drivers.  https://github.com/systemd/casync
