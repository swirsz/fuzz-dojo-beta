OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language.  It consists of two libraries, one for implementing JPEG 2000 files and also a client/server architecture for remote browsing of JPEG 2000 images known as jpip.  The project reached 52% code coverage in 2024 with 2 fuzz drivers, one fuzz driver for each library, however a more recent change has broken the code coverage details of the project.
