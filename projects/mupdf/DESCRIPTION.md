Mupdf is an open source software framework written in C that implements a PDF, XPS, and EPUB parsing and rendering engine. A single fuzz driver simulates creating a PDF, and reaches 50% of the code.

This project has many verification functions that are not currently tested.  Many testing scripts exist in a scripts folder in the project repository: https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mupdf.git;a=tree
