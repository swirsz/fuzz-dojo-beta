Fuzz Introspector

XVid is a video codec life for the mpeg-4 standard.  The source code repository is no longer accessible online so it is broken on oss-fuzz, but the source code files are still available here and the project compiles and works properly.    A single fuzz driver reaches 33% of the project code.
