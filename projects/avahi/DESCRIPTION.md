From your host at 10.0.0.1, connect to the remote host at 10.0.0.2 on port 31337.

A great way to do this is to use the `nc` command (pronounced "netcat"), which allows you to open network connections from the command line.
For example, to connect to the remote host at 10.0.0.42 on port 4242, you would run:

```sh
nc 10.0.0.42 4242
```
