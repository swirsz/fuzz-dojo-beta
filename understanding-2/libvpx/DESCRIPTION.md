Libvpx is a free software video codec library that serves as the reference software implementation for the VP8 and VP9 video coding formats, and for AV1.  It has 2 decoding fuzz drivers, one for VP8 and another for VP9 that reaches 60% of the code.  The source code includes hundreds of unit tests in /test and additional code under /examples that could be turned into new fuzz drivers.
