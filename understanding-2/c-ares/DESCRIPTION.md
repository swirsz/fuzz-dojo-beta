Run `/challenge/run` to copy fuzz drivers into `/home/hacker/fuzz-dojo/{project}`

Edit each of these files and add comments to the code to demonstrate your understanding of their operation. A flag will be provided when sufficient comments are added to each driver, and your comments will be evaluated later.

C-Ares is a C library for asynchronous DNS requests.  It has two simple fuzz drivers, one that validates URLs, and a legacy fuzz driver that providea sample code to execute many different parsing functions.

Useful today since all of these parsing functions have been simplified into a single function.

Only 1/3 of the code is currently being hit by sending simple random parsing requests. Fuzz drivers designed to exercise the specific features of this  library  may be able to hit additional source code. https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/blob/main/FEATURES.md

Implementing a simplified custom DNS parser also may also do a better job than sending simple random requests.
