Run `/challenge/run` to copy fuzz drivers into `/home/hacker/fuzz-dojo/{project}`

Edit each of these files and add comments to the code to demonstrate your understanding of their operation. A flag will be provided when sufficient comments are added to each driver, and your comments will be evaluated later.

Fuzz Introspector

casync is a Content Addressable Data Synchronizer, a tool that combines the rsync algorithm with content addressable storage.

This projects has a single fuzz driver that compresses and decomposes a stream of random data, but only hits 10% of the project code. Many different compression options, such as XZ and LibZ are not called, and none of the utility functions are executed.  The github project page lists a number of operations that could be implemented in fuzz drivers.  https://github.com/systemd/casync
