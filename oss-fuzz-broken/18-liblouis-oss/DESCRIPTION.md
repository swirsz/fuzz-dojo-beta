Fuzz Introspector

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator.  

3 existing fuzz drivers test the main functionality of the project already, translation and back translation.  Only small sections of code are unreached and seem to be spread out in many small miscellaneous functions.  A folder of test cases exists for this project that might provide sample code that could be useful in reaching these functions.
