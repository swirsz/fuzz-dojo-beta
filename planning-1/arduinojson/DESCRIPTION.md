This module aims to dive into the source code of your target program and develop a conceptual plan to create a new fuzz driver.  Now that you are familiar with the existing fuzz drivers, consider what is not currently being fuzzed.

Before writing any code, familiarize yourself with the project's architecture.  One way of doing this is to ask an AI platform to "explain the different files in the <project name> source code folder."

Browse the source code and fuzz introspector report and identify the parsing functions, input handlers, and data processing routines.  Are there any other components that process untrusted input?  As you consider your driver, focus on functions high in the call tree and consider state dependencies and requirements.  Does this function require corpus data, such as image files or sound files, as input?  What initiation is needed by the program before this function typically executes?  What sequence of operations makes the most sense?

After spending some time in the project code, describe your conceptual fuzz driver using a few English sentences, and paste that into the text input prompt of `/challenge/run` to achieve the flag.

Fuzz Introspector

ArduinoJson is a C++ JSON library

Fuzz introspective reports that it has 99.51% static reachability, but only 49% actual coverage is being reached by the 2 existing fuzz drivers.

Plenty of functions in the code coverage report show 0% coverage, and these would be ideal to call with a new fuzz driver.
