Alembic is an open framework for storing and sharing scene data that includes a C++ library, a file format, and client plugins and applications.

Alembic has only a single fuzz driver that is shown as blocked by static analysis, reaching almost no code at all.  Dynamic analysis shows 10% coverage, with lots of potential for new fuzz drivers.
