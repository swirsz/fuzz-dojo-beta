The arm astc-encoder or Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) Encoder, astcenc, is a command-line tool for compressing and decompressing images using the ASTC texture compression standard.

The encoder has 1 fuzz driver that covers symbolic_to_physical and reaches 50% of the project coverage. A second single function symbolic_to_physical  should reach the majority of the remaining code.
