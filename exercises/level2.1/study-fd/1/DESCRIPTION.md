Fuzz Introspector

Args is a simple, small, flexible, single-header C++11 argument parsing library.  It is similar to Python's argparse, but in C++.

A single fuzz driver hits just about half of the project code, but many features in this single-file project are not addressed. These include Validation, Match, GetDescription, Arg Parsing, etc.
