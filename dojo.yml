  Projects show a project size in lines of code, code coverage percentages, and a compile time. 
  
  For example: `JSON - 8008 loc 68%-74%-94% - 45 sec`
  
  - `8008 loc` - This means that the source code has 8008 lines of code
  - `68%` - When fuzzing for 30 seconds after running `/challenge/loc` it will explore 68% of the project
  - `74%` - Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure performing continuous fuzzing explores 74% of the code
  - `94%` - static analysis shows that existing fuzz drivers have the theoretical ability to reach 94% of the code. This is not always accurate.
  - `45 seconds` - how long /challenge/loc requires to recalculate the code coverage when recompiling ONLY the fuzz drivers. The initial build requires more time, simply rebuilding with /challenge/build will require less time.

  Useful commands:

  `/challenge/build (sanitizer)` Run this first.  Compiles oss-fuzz project currently configured. Copies fuzz driver source code into `/home/hacker/fuzz-dojo/(project)` Project Source code is placed in: `/src-orig` Fuzz drivers: `/out`
  
  - `(sanitizer)` is an OPTIONAL value of `none` (Default) `address memory undefined thread coverage` or `inspector`
  
  `/challenge/rebuild (sanitizer)` Recompiles ONLY the fuzz drivers and not the entire project.

  - `(sanitizer)` is an OPTIONAL value of `none` (Default) `address memory undefined thread coverage` or `inspector`
  
  `/out/(driver)` Runs a fuzz driver compiled with `/challenge/build`

  `/challenge/loc (sanitizer) (driver)` Compiles and runs all fuzz drivers for 30 seconds, reports LOC and functional coverage of each fuzz driver and the entire project.

  - `(sanitizer)` is an OPTIONAL value of `none` (Default) `address memory undefined` or `thread`

  - `(driver)` is an OPTIONAL value of exactly 1 fuzz driver to execute and provide coverage data instead of executing all fuzz drivers.

  `/challenge/fuzz-introspector` Compiles project and creates Fuzz Introspector report that can be viewed in a web browser under `Desktop`

  `report` Start Web server to view coverage report previously generated by `/challenge/loc`
   
  `fi-report` Start Web server to view coverage report previously generated by `/challenge/fuzz-introspector`

  `loc-report` View quick LOC report previously generated by `/challenge/loc`

  `find-drv (keyword)` Locates all fuzz drivers within `/src-orig`
  
  - `(keyword)` is an OPTIONAL value of a text string to search the source code for, rather than for fuzz drivers references

  `drivers` Lists all fuzz drivers within `/out`

  `test-crashes` Tests all crash files within the `/out` directory by executing all fuzz drivers with all crash files

  `. e` Sets necessary environment variables to run oss-fuzz scripts manually
