  Useful commands:
  
  
  `/challenge/build afl (sanitizer)` Compiles oss-fuzz project using AFL instead of LibFuzzer
  
  `/challenge/build (sanitizer)` Compiles oss-fuzz project currently configured. Copies fuzz driver source code into `/home/hacker/(project)` Project Source code is placed in: `/src` Fuzz drivers: `/out`

  - `(sanitizer)` is an optional value of `none` (Default) `address memory undefined thread coverage` or `inspector`

  `/challenge/loc (sanitizer) (driver)` Compiles and runs all fuzz drivers for 30 seconds, reports LOC and functional coverage of each fuzz driver and the entire project.

  - `(sanitizer)` is an optional value of `none` (Default) `address memory undefined` or `thread`

  - `(driver)` is an optional value of exactly 1 fuzz driver to execute and provide coverage data instead of executing all fuzz drivers.

  `/challenge/fuzz-introspector` Compiles project and creates Fuzz Introspector report that can be viewed in a web browser under `Desktop`

  `report` Start Web server to view coverage report previously generated by `/challenge/loc`
   
  `fi-report` Start Web server to view coverage report previously generated by `/challenge/fuzz-introspector`

  `loc-report` View quick LOC report previously generated by `/challenge/loc`

  `find-drv` Locates all fuzz drivers within `/src`

  `test-crashes` Tests all crash files within the `/out` directory by executing all fuzz drivers with all crash files

  `. e` Sets necessary environment variables to run oss-fuzz scripts manually
