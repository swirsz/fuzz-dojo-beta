This module is identical to the projects module.  Take what you've learned from the 'Understanding Fuzz Drivers' module and implement your plan from the 'Planning New Fuzz Drivers' module to make a simple fuzz driver that achieves at least a 5% boost in total project coverage.

Fuzz Introspector
https://storage.googleapis.com/oss-fuzz-introspector/wasm3/inspector-report/20250411/fuzz_report.html

Wasm3 is a WebAssembly interpreter and the most universal WASM runtime.  It has a single fuzz driver reaching 67% of the code.  This fuzz driver parses and executes code, but other functionality of the project is not addressed.  For example, the m3_exec source code is not well covered, suggesting that since this function handles the interpreter's execution loop and instruction handlers, a fuzz driver generating more valid instructions might exercise this code.   Valid instructions that are not being executed include stack operations, arithmetic operations, memory operations, comparison operations, direct and indirect function calls.
