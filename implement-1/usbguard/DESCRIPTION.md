This module is identical to the projects module.  Take what you've learned from the 'Understanding Fuzz Drivers' module and implement your plan from the 'Planning New Fuzz Drivers' module to make a simple fuzz driver that achieves at least a 5% boost in total project coverage.

Fuzz Introspector

USBGuard is a software framework for implementing USB device authorization policies. 3 fuzz drivers reach 41% of the project code.  97% static code coverage indicates that large sections of the code could possibly be called by these existing fuzz drivers but currently is not.

For example, the appliesToWithConditions, a function in RulePrivate.cpp that checks if a rule applies to a given device with additional conditions is mostly untested.
