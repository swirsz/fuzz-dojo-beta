This module is identical to the projects module.  Take what you've learned from the 'Understanding Fuzz Drivers' module and implement your plan from the 'Planning New Fuzz Drivers' module to make a simple fuzz driver that achieves at least a 5% boost in total project coverage.

Fuzz Introspector

ArduinoJson is a C++ JSON library

Fuzz introspective reports that it has 99.51% static reachability, but only 49% actual coverage is being reached by the 2 existing fuzz drivers.

Plenty of functions in the code coverage report show 0% coverage, and these would be ideal to call with a new fuzz driver.
